A Simple Python program in which I showed the how we can implement `Switch Case` as we do in other programming languages using `Conditional statement`.

## Conversions I programmed:
- Mass
  1. Kilograms(kg) to Gram(g)
  2. Gram(g) to Kilograms(kg) 
  3. Tonne to Kilograms(kg)
  4. Kilograms(kg) to Tonne

- Speed
  1. Kilometers per hour(kmph) to Miles per hour(mph)
  2. Kilometers per hour(kmph) to Meters per hour(mps) 
  3. Miles per hour(mph) to Kilometers per hour(kmph)

- Temperature
    1. Degree Celcius to Farenheit
    2. Degree Celcius to Kelvin 
    3. Farenheit to Degree Celcius

  Similarly, you can do many conversions,
  - **Length**: meter, centimeter, millimeter, kilometer, yard, foot, etc.
  - **Time**: seconds, minutes, days, weeks, year, etc.
  - **Area**: square meter, square kilometer, hectare, acre, etc.
  - **Volume**: litre, millilitre, gallon, etc.
  - **Digital Storage**: Byte, kilobyte, terabyte, megabyte, pebibyte, etc.
  - and many different conversions.

  You can create a full application based on this idea which might be very useful for many people.
